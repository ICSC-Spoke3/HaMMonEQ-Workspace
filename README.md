# HaMMonEQ-Workspace

**HaMMonEQ-Workspace** is a workspace designed to support the creation and preparation of original training datasets for semantic segmentation algorithms. The primary goal is to enable the individuation and  segmentation of **cracks** on building facades, as they appear in the textures of 3D models.

## Overview

This repository provides tools and scripts for:

- **Manipulating public datasets** 
- **Applying data augmentation** 
- **Processing original images and manually annotated segmentation masks**.
- **Generating synthetic datasets**
